### [EDA: Effect of Time Elapsed on Gene Expressions] (./EDA Effect of Time Elapsed on Gene Expressions.ipynb)
About the data: I examined a dataset of gene expressions found in this research paper. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE5859
This paper looks at the allelic differences among a wide variety of ethnicities across the world. More specifically the data shows the gene expression level found in lympoblasts. Lympoblasts are immature white blood cells that eventually develops into a type of immune cell called lympocyte. If lympoblasts grow and divide uncontrollably, they cause what's known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Skills used:
1. Pandas for data wrangling
2. Matplotlib for data visiualization
3. Linalg.svd (single value decomposition) for dimension reduction
