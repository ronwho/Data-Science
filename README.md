### [EDA: Effect of Time Elapsed on Gene Expressions](https://github.com/ronwho/Data-Science/blob/master/EDA%20Effect%20of%20Time%20Elapsed%20on%20Gene%20Expressions.ipynb)
* I examined a dataset of gene expressions found in this research paper. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE5859
* This paper looks at the allelic differences among a wide variety of ethnicities across the world. More specifically the data shows the gene expression level found in lympoblasts. Lympoblasts are immature white blood cells that eventually develops into a type of immune cell called lympocyte. If lympoblasts grow and divide uncontrollably, they cause what's known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
* For the final result, I found that after 100 days of sampling, there was a inconsistency with the data
Skills used:
1. Pandas for data wrangling
2. Matplotlib for data visiualization
3. Linalg.svd (single value decomposition) for dimension reduction
